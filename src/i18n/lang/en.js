Deposit, Escrow, Withdrawal and Transfer</p><p><br></p><p>Services are only available for digital assets that we support, and such digital assets may change from time to time. Under no circumstances may you use your account to store, send, request or receive digital assets in any form not supported by us. We are not responsible or liable for any attempt to use the account for digital assets that we do not support. We provide services to you and are not a buyer or seller of any digital asset transaction. Services do not include any deposit or withdrawal or custody of any fiat currency.</p><p><br></p><p>All digital assets in the account are hosted by us, which means:</p><p><br></p><p>(i) Title to digital assets remains with you and is not transferred to us. Since the owner of digital assets is your account, you should bear all risk of loss of such digital assets. We do not represent that the assets in the account belong to us, nor will it befor oneself;</p><p><br></p><p>(ii) we may not grant security interests in digital assets in the Account;</p><p><br></p><p>(iii) we will not sell, transfer, lend, mortgage or otherwise transfer assets in the Account unless required by the relevant authorities or otherwise provided in this Agreement, except as directed by you or compelled by a court of competent jurisdiction;</p><p><br></p><p>(iv) You are in control of the digital assets in the Account. You may withdraw your digital assets at any time by sending them to another blockchain address controlled by you or a third party, subject to interruptions, downtime and other applicable policies;</p><p><br></p><p>(v) In order to more securely hold the assets in the account, separate your digital assets from our own digital assets or funds through separate ledger accounting entries for the user account and our account. Notwithstanding the above, we are under no obligation to use different blockchain addresses to store your and other customers' digital assets or ours.</p><p><br></p><p>We reserve the right to set and adjust daily transaction volume and withdrawal limits based on internal considerations, including the security and state of the underlying digital asset network.</p><p><br></p><p>6. Digital Asset Network</p><p><br></p><p>6.1 Digital Asset Transaction</p><p><br></p><p>We will process the transaction according to your instructions. You should verify all transaction information before giving us instructions. We do not guarantee the identity of any user, recipient, requestee or other third party, nor do we have any responsibility or obligation to ensure that the information you provide is accurate and complete. Once a transaction is propagated to the relevant digital asset network, it cannot be reversed.</p><p><br></p><p>We may charge network fees ("miner fees") to conduct transactions on your behalf. We will calculate the miner fee on our own, but will inform you of the miner fee when (or before) you authorize digital asset transactions. When you or a third party send digital assets to an account through an external wallet that is not hosted by the platform, the transaction originator is solely responsible for the correct execution of the transaction, which may include paying miner fees for the successful completion of the transaction. Failure to pay miner fees may leave your transactions in a pending state beyond our control, and we are not responsible for delays or losses due to errors in transaction initiation, nor are we obligated to assist in remediating such transactions.</p><p><br></p><p>Once a transaction is submitted to the digital asset network, the transaction will remain unconfirmed for a period of time until the digital asset network fully confirms the transaction. A transaction is pending, which means the transaction has not been completed. Accordingly, digital assets associated with transactions that are in a pending state will be indicated and will not be included in account balances and transactions cannot be made until confirmed by the network.</p><p><br></p><p>We may also refuse to enter into or cancel any pending transaction as required by law, regulation or any court or other authority of competent jurisdiction if money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud or any other financial crime is suspected.</p><p><br></p><p>6.2 Operation of Digital Asset Protocol</p><p><br></p><p>We do not own or control the underlying software protocols that govern the operations of digital assets supported on the platform. Typically, the underlying protocol is an "open source" protocol that can be used, copied, modified, and distributed by all.</p><p><br></p><p>We are not responsible for the operation of the underlying protocol and cannot guarantee the functionality or security of the network operation. You acknowledge and accept that the underlying software agreements related to any digital assets you store in your account may change.</p><p><br></p><p>In particular, the underlying protocol may be affected by sudden changes ("forks") in the rules of operation. Any such material operational changes may materially affect the availability, value, functionality and/or name of the Digital Assets you store in your Account. We have no control over the timing and nature of these major operational changes. It is your responsibility to be aware of impending operational changes. When deciding whether to continue to use your account to trade affected digital assets, you must carefully consider publicly available information and information we may provide. In the event of any such operational changes, we reserve the right to take necessary measures to maintain the safety and security of assets on the platform, including necessary measures such as temporarily suspending the operation of relevant digital assets.</p><p><br></p><p>We will do our best to notify you of our actions on any significant operational changes. However, these changes are beyond our control and may occur without our knowledge. We will act at our sole discretion with respect to any major operational changes, including a decision not to support any new digital assets, forks or other operations.</p><p><br></p><p>You acknowledge and accept the risks brought about by changes in the operation of the digital asset agreement, and agree that we shall not be liable for such changes in operation, nor shall we be liable for any loss of value you suffer as a result of such changes in operating rules. You acknowledge and accept that we have the right to act on any operational changes at our sole discretion and that we have no obligation to assist you with unsupported assets or protocols.</p><p><br></p><p>7. Trading Rules</p><p><br></p><p>When trading digital assets on the platform, you should abide by the following rules:</p><p><br></p><p>(i) You should read, understand and fully accept the information on the platform, including but not limited to prices, fees and whether digital assets are being bought or sold, before executing the transaction;</p><p><br></p><p>(ii) When you execute a transaction and submit a transaction, you authorize the platform to act as the broker of the relevant transaction and match the relevant transaction counterparty for the transaction without prior notice to you;</p><p><br></p><p>(iii) you have the right to cancel or modify the transaction at any time before executing the transaction;</p><p><br></p><p>(iv) You can view transaction details and records on the Platform.</p><p><br></p><p>7.1 Exchange rate</p><p><br></p><p>Every purchase or sale of a digital asset is affected by the exchange rate of that particular transaction. "Exchange Rate" means the price of a specific supported digital asset quoted in fiat currency on the Platform. The exchange rate is referred to as the "buy price" or "ask price", and represents the price at which you can buy or sell a digital asset, respectively.</p><p><br></p><p>You acknowledge that, at any given time, the bid price exchange rate may differ from the ask price exchange rate and that there may be a difference or "spread" in the exchange rate quoted. By authorizing the transaction, you agree to accept the exchange rate. We do not guarantee any exchange rate.

Deposit, Escrow, Withdrawal and Transfer</p><p><br></p><p>Services are only available for digital assets that we support, and such digital assets may change from time to time. Under no circumstances should you use a futures account to store, send, request or receive digital assets in any form that we do not support. We are not responsible or liable for any attempt to use futures accounts for digital assets that we do not support. We provide services to you and are not a buyer or seller of any digital asset transaction. Services do not include any deposit or withdrawal or custody of any fiat currency.</p><p><br></p><p>All digital assets held in futures accounts are held by us in escrow, unless otherwise provided by the Platform or this Agreement. That is:</p><p><br></p><p>(i) Title to digital assets remains with you and is not transferred to us. Since the owner of digital assets is your futures account, you should bear all risk of loss of such digital assets. We do not represent that the assets in the futures account belong to us, nor do we regard such assets as our own;</p><p><br></p><p>(ii) We will not sell, transfer, lend, mortgage or otherwise transfer assets in the Futures Account unless required by the relevant authorities or otherwise provided in this Agreement, except as directed by you or compelled by a court of competent jurisdiction ;</p><p><br></p><p>(iii) You are in charge of digital assets in your futures account.

We are under no obligation to use different blockchain addresses to store your and other customers' digital assets or our digital assets.</p><p><br></p><p>We reserve the right to set and adjust daily transaction volume and withdrawal limits based on internal considerations, including any investigation by the relevant authorities, the security and status of the relevant digital asset network and/or any loans due and payable (as defined in this Agreement) .</p><p><br></p><p>6. Futures Trading</p><p><br></p><p>After successfully registering a futures account, you can transfer digital assets to the futures account in order to place an order ("Order") on the platform. You can execute orders to enter and/or exit your positions in digital assets currently available on the platform through the order types available on the platform.</p><p><br></p><p>Each user is responsible for any orders placed on the Platform, including ensuring that orders are properly submitted on the Platform through the relevant website, mobile application or other means permitted by us from time to time. From time to time, the platform may reject an order and it is your responsibility to ensure that the order is executed. We are not responsible for any loss caused by your failure to submit any order or the order being rejected by the platform. Submitting orders to the Platform is at your own risk. We have the right to rely on all orders submitted through the futures account and all transactions executed through the futures account, and you are bound by such orders and transactions.</p><p><br></p><p>We reserve the right to modify, suspend or terminate any or all order types and digital assets tradable on the Platform at any time in our sole discretion; we are not responsible for any loss you suffer as a result of such modification, suspension or termination.</p><p><br></p><p>To prevent market manipulation, we may place position and order size limits on futures accounts ("Order Limits"). If you exceed your order limit, we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to reduce your position or close out or cancel your order ("Order Limit Prevention Mechanism"). You are solely responsible for any losses you may suffer as a result of the Order Restriction Prevention Mechanism.</p><p><br></p><p>7. Index</p><p><br></p><p>For each Digital Asset tradable on the Platform, the Platform uses an index based on the price of the relevant Digital Asset on certain other exchanges ("Index Data") (the "Index") to determine an index for each Digital Asset on the Platform price. Index data is retrieved through API connections to other relevant exchanges.</p><p><br></p><p>We reserve the right, in our sole discretion and without prior notice to you, to adjust the index components and their relative weights in the index. If there is an error in retrieving the index data, or there is a large deviation in the index components, resulting in a large deviation between the index price and the actual transaction price of digital assets on the platform, we will not be responsible for any losses arising therefrom.</p><p><br></p><p>8. Margin</p><p><br></p><p>The margin service provided by the Platform ("Margin Service") allows you to use digital assets ("Margin") in your futures account to borrow other digital assets to execute trades on the Platform. By using margin services, you agree that you fully understand the risks associated with margin services and agree that you will use margin services at your own risk.</p><p><br></p><p>You shall deposit and maintain Digital Assets in the Futures Account in the form and amount required by us, whereby we may request maintenance margin services from time to time in our sole discretion. The list of digital assets approved by us as eligible for margin shall be specified by us, and certain digital assets can only be valued according to the margin adjustment factor (as defined in this Agreement). We are under no obligation to inform you of any changes to the valuation of digital assets used as margins.</p><p><br></p><p>We have sole discretion to determine margin requirements on the Platform ("Margin Requirements") and reserve the right to change Margin Requirements from time to time without prior notice to you.

We are under no obligation to consider digital assets outside of your futures account if you require a margin call.</p><p><br></p><p>All deposits shall be held by us as continuing security. Such all deposits are subject to general liens and rights of set-off in our favour with respect to any and all obligations, liabilities or monies due from you at any time and due to us under this Agreement or otherwise.

We reserve the right to announce early settlement ("Early Settlement") at our sole discretion without prior notice to you due to concerns about the underlying digital assets or to ensure a fair and orderly market. We are not responsible for any losses related to early settlement. In the case of early settlement, all relevant positions will be settled at a time determined by us.</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>15.

Cross margin leverage</p><p><br></p><p>You should provide a margin for cross-margin trading, and the amount of margin is equal to the equity of the digital assets in the cross-margin account ("Margin Account") multiplied by the corresponding margin adjustment factor ("Margin Adjustment Factor"). The margin adjustment factor refers to the factor that converts the token margin to its market price when calculating the margin amount. We reserve the right, without prior notice to you, from time to time:</p><p><br></p><p>(i) adjust the margin adjustment factor;</p><p><br></p><p>(ii) determine the types of relevant tokens that can be borrowed;</p><p><br></p><p>(iii) Setting margin limits for specific tokens.</p><p><br></p><p>3. Loans</p><p><br></p><p>The maximum loan amount is the maximum amount of tokens you can borrow from us. The platform will calculate your current maximum loan amount based on the maximum borrowing amount you can use for cross margin leverage, margin adjustment factors, platform rules and other constraints that we may consider from time to time.</p><p><br></p><p>After obtaining a leveraged loan, the borrowed digital assets will be immediately transferred to your cross-margin account, and the platform will start charging interest immediately after the transfer.</p><p><br></p><p>4. Leverage</p><p><br></p><p>The maximum loan amount depends on the digital assets in the futures account and the leverage you choose.</p><p><br></p><p>5. Interest</p><p><br></p><p>Loan interest will be calculated at the hourly service rate. If the time is less than 60 minutes, it will be regarded as 1 hour.
